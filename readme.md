# CourseQuest

The repository for our the RAIN Hackathon 1.0 project

## note

We will eventually make this repo public later, so lets make sure to keep our code clean and organized.

## rules
The main branch is the production branch i.e: it is the latest stable update, if we are presenting, we'll present that branch.

PLEASE, NO matter what, DO NOT push to the main branch.
 as youre contributing, create your branches and work on them.
 Every update to the main branch will be reviewed and merged.
 But before that, MERGE WITH MY BRANCH FIRST, then ill push to main when necessary.

Contributors: Please, minimise AI use, and if you must use ai, make sure you know exactly WHAT that code is doing,
and why it is doing it.
I'd also advise we use the same IDE, and if you are using VS Code, please use the same/similar extensions.
    i'll add my extensions to the .vscode folder later, and you can use them.
I say this because we'll eventually have to write docs for our code, and we'll need to be on the same page.
although ill prob handle docs myself, with little help from you guys.
